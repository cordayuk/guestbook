<h1>Guestbook</h1>
<p>Guestbook is a simple <b>Java</b> web-app that lets users post a message that will be displayed on the home page with the latest message showing at the top.
The idea of this web-app was for me to gain experiance in setting up and deploying a simple web application that updates and displays very basic data from a database.
The application is using <b>Gradle</b>, <b>Spring-boot</b>, <b>Hibernate</b>, <b>Thymeleaf</b>. The templates only use <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> 
and require further optimisation, also I am currently learn some Javascript with the intention of improving my frontend web development</p>
