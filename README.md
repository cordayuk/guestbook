<p>Guestbook is a simple <b>Java</b> web-app that lets users post a message that will be displayed on the home page with the latest message showing at the top.
The idea of this web-app was for me to gain experiance in setting up and deploying a simple web application that updates and displays very basic data from a database.
The application is using <b>Gradle</b>, <b>Spring-boot</b>, <b>Hibernate</b>, <b>Thymeleaf</b> and uses a <b>H2</b> database or on the MySQL branch it is setup for a <b>MySQL</b> database for use with Amazon Web Services. It has been deployed on <b>Amazon Web Services</b> and can be found <a href="http://guestbook-env.eu-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. The templates only use <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> 
and require further optimisation, also I am currently learning Javascript with the intention of improving my frontend web development.</p>
